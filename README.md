#  Calendar Application

## Overview

Astro-Saurav is a Tkinter-based desktop application that displays a calendar for a given year. The application dynamically generates a calendar view, with each month's background color changing automatically every 3 seconds. The main window allows users to input a year and view the calendar for that year in a new window.
